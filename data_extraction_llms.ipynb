The Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA)\\nwas created solely and speciﬁcally to recruit and hire Nazi\\nscientists and put them on weapons projects and in\\nscientiﬁc intelligence programs within the army, the navy,\\nthe air force, the CIA (starting in 1947), and other\\norganizations. In some cases, when individual scientists had\\nbeen too close to Hitler, the JIOA hired them to work at U.S.\\nmilitary facilities in occupied Germany. The JIOA was a\\nsubcommittee of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC),\\nwhich provided national security information for the Joint\\nChiefs of Staﬀ. The JIC remains the least known and least\\nstudied U.S. intelligence agency of the twentieth century. To\\nunderstand the mind-set of the Joint Intelligence\\nCommittee, consider this: Within one year of the atomic\\nbombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the JIC warned the\\nJoint Chiefs of Staﬀ that the United States needed to\\nprepare for “total war” with the Soviets—to include atomic,\\nchemical, and biological warfare—and they even set an\\nestimated start date of 1952. This book focuses on that\\nuneasy period, from 1945 to 1952, in which the JIOA’s\\nrecruitment of Nazi scientists was forever on the rise,\\nculminating in Accelerated Paperclip, which allowed\\nindividuals previously deemed undesirable to be brought to\\nthe United States—including Major General Dr. Walter\\nSchreiber, the surgeon general of the Third Reich.\\nOperation Paperclip left behind a legacy of ballistic\\nmissiles, sarin gas cluster bombs, underground bunkers,\\nspace capsules, and weaponized bubonic plague. It also left\\nbehind a trail of once-secret documents that I accessed to\\nreport this book, including postwar interrogation reports,\\narmy intelligence security dossiers, Nazi Party paperwork,\\nAllied intelligence armaments reports, declassiﬁed JIOA\\nmemos, Nuremberg trial testimony, oral histories, a\\ngeneral’s desk diaries, and a Nuremberg war crimes'),\n",

Its commander,\\nGeneral Carl A. “Tooey” Spaatz, had just received a fourth\\nstar for his success commanding the largest ﬂeet of combat\\naircraft ever assembled for war. Now Spaatz had a new\\nmission for his ﬁeld commanders. “Operation Lusty,” Spaatz\\nwrote in a memo, was “in eﬀect,” and everyone “not\\nengaged in critical operational duties” was to seek out\\n“technical and scientiﬁc intelligence [that would be] of\\nmaterial assistance in the prosecution of the war against\\nJapan.” The man Spaatz chose to lead the hunt for\\nLuftwaﬀe scientists and engineers was Colonel Donald L.\\nPutt.\\nWhen Putt arrived at Völkenrode on April 22, 1945, he\\nwas thrilled by what he saw. All he could think about was\\nhow quickly he could get all this equipment back to the\\nUnited States. Putt was a legendary test pilot who had been\\nat Wright Field since 1933, assigned to various branches,\\nincluding the Flying Branch. He had walked away from a\\ndeadly air crash that killed his colleagues and left him with\\nsecond-degree burn scars on his face and neck. Putt was a\\nhard-charging, Type A personality—a tiger among men. “He\\ndisplayed the ability to withstand great emotional shock, to\\nabsorb it, and take in stride,” explained a colleague from\\nWright Field. Putt was also intellectually gifted, with a'),\n",

As an older man,\\nDonald Putt recalled the prewar mind-set regarding pilots\\nwho were also engineers. “Then, the philosophy was, ‘Don’t\\nput an engineering pilot in the cockpit, because he tries to\\nﬁgure out why things happen.’ ” But when the air wars in\\nEurope and Japan escalated, the Army Air Forces found\\nitself in need of fast, out-of-the-box thinking from American\\npilot-engineers like Putt. The Army Air Forces put the old\\nphilosophy to the side and Putt’s expertise to use. In 1944,\\nPutt’s career milestone arrived when he was put in charge\\nof modifying a B-29 bomber so that it could deliver an\\nextraordinarily heavy, Top Secret payload on Japan. This\\npayload was eventually revealed to be the atomic bombs\\ndropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After Putt ﬁnished his\\nB-29 bomber retroﬁtting jobs, in January 1945, he was sent\\noverseas as director of technical services for the Air Service\\nCommand. Now here he was in the last week of April 1945\\nat Völkenrode.\\nWith his engineer’s expertise, Putt was able to clearly\\njudge the revolutionary nature of the technology he was\\nlooking at. Most astonishing to Putt were Völkenrode’s\\nseven wind tunnels that had allowed the Luftwaﬀe to study\\nhow a swept-back wing would behave at the speed at which\\nan aircraft broke the sound barrier. This transition place,\\nbetween Mach 0.8 and Mach 1.2, was still unknown to\\nAmerican ﬂiers in 1945. When Putt learned from\\nVölkenrode’s director, Adolf Busemann, that the sound\\nbarrier had already been breached by German scientists in\\nthese wind tunnels, he was amazed. Putt knew immediately\\nthat the facility had “the most superb instruments and test\\nequipment” in the world.\\nPutt was taking orders from the U.S. Army, European\\nTheater of Operations, Directorate of Intelligence,\\nExploitation Division, which meant that he had access to'),\n",

In May 1937\\nSchrader was invited to Berlin to demonstrate how he’d\\nsynthesized Preparation 9/91. “Everyone was astounded,”\\nSchrader told Tilley. This was the most promising chemical\\nkiller since the Germans invented mustard gas. Preparation\\n9/91 was classiﬁed Top Secret and given a code name:\\ntabun gas. It came from the English word “taboo,”\\nsomething prohibited or forbidden.\\nDr. Schrader was told to produce one kilogram for the\\nGerman army, which would take over tabun production on a\\nmassive scale. Schrader got a bonus of 50,000 reichsmarks\\n(the average German worker during this time period\\nearned 3,100 reichsmarks a year) and was told to get back\\nto work. Farben still needed him to develop a lice-killing\\ninsecticide.\\nWith their new nerve agent tabun, Farben executives\\nsaw all kinds of business opportunities. Karl Krauch, the\\nhead of Farben’s board of directors, began working with\\nHermann Göring on a longer-range plan to arm Germany\\nwith chemical weapons, ones that could eventually be\\ndropped on the enemy from airplanes.

Otto Ambros was put in charge\\nof masterminding this undertaking as well. The place\\nchosen was Auschwitz.\\nOnce, Auschwitz was a regular town. “Ordinary people\\nlived there, and tourists visited to see the castle, the\\nchurches, the large medieval market square, and the\\nsynagogue,” write historians Debórah Dwork and Robert\\nJan van Pelt. In the 1930s, visitors sent postcards from the\\narea that read “Greetings from Auschwitz.” When, in the\\nfall of 1940, Otto Ambros pored over maps of this region,\\ncalled Upper Silesia, in search of a Buna factory site, he\\nfound what he was looking for. The production of synthetic\\nrubber required four things: water, ﬂat land, good railway\\nconnections, and an abundance of laborers. Auschwitz had\\nall four. Three rivers met in Auschwitz, the Sola, the Vistula,\\nand the Przemsza, with a water ﬂow of 525,000 cubic feet\\nper hour. The land was ﬂat and sixty-ﬁve feet above the\\nwaterline, making it safe from ﬂoodwaters. The railway\\nconnections were sound. But most important was the labor\\nissue. The concentration camp next door could provide an\\nendless labor supply because the men were cheap and\\ncould be worked to death.\\nFor Farben, the use of slave labor could take the\\ncompany to levels of economic prowess previously\\nunexplored. First, a ﬁnancial deal had to be made with the\\nSS. Ambros was instrumental in this act. For months, before\\nthe building of the Buna factory got the go-ahead, the SS\\nand Farben haggled over deal points. Some of the\\npaperwork survived the war. On November 8, 1940, the\\nReich’s minister of economics wrote to Farben’s board of\\ndirectors, requesting that they hurry up and “settle the\\nquestion regarding the site.” Otto Ambros lobbied hard for\\nAuschwitz, and in December, IG Farben sent a busload of its\\nrubber experts and construction workers to survey the\\nwork site.

Over the next\\nnineteen months, Blome explained, he met with Himmler\\nﬁve times.\\nAt their ﬁrst meeting, which occurred in the summer of\\n1943—Blome recalled it as being July or August—Himmler\\nordered Blome to study various dissemination methods of\\nplague bacteria for oﬀensive warfare. According to Blome,\\nhe shared with Himmler his fears regarding the dangerous\\nboomerang eﬀect a plague bomb would most likely have on\\nGermany. Himmler told Blome that in that case, he should\\nget to work immediately to produce a vaccine to prevent\\nsuch a thing. To expedite vaccine research, Blome said,\\nHimmler ordered him “to use human beings.”\\nHimmler oﬀered Blome a medical block at a\\nconcentration camp like Dachau where he could complete\\nthis work. Blome said he told Himmler he was aware of\\n“strong objections in certain circles” to using humans in\\nexperimental vaccine trials. Himmler told Blome that'),\n",

He considered himself a loyal Nazi,\\nand it was his intention to help Germany win the war.\\n“History gives us examples of human disease aﬀecting the\\noutcome of wars,” Blome told his Alsos interrogators, taking\\na moment to lecture them on history. “We know [that] from\\nantiquity up till the time of [the] Napoleonic wars, victories\\nand defeats were often determined by epidemics and\\nstarvation,” Blome said. Spreading an infectious disease\\ncould bring about the demise of a marauding army, and\\nBlome said that the failure of Napoleon’s Russian campaign\\nwas “due in great part to the infection of his horses with\\nGlanders,” a highly contagious bacterial disease. History\\naside, Blome said he counseled Himmler on the fact that a\\nconcentration camp was a terrible place to experiment with\\nbubonic plague because the population was too dense.\\nBlome then told Himmler that if he were to experiment\\nwith plague bacterium, he would need his own institute, an\\nisolated facility far removed from population centers.\\nHimmler and Blome agreed that Poland would be a good\\nplace, and they settled on Nesselstedt, a small town outside\\nthe former Poznań University (by then operated by the\\nReich). Blome’s research institute was to be called the\\nBacteriological Institute at Nesselstedt.\\nIn the interim, in Berlin, Blome oversaw a ﬁeld test using\\nrats, history’s traditional carrier of bubonic plague. A\\ndebate had been taking place inside the Hygiene Institute\\nof the Waﬀen-SS as to whether or not rats were the best\\nplague carriers. Himmler’s idea was “to take infected rats\\non to U-boats and release them near the enemy shores so\\nthey could swim to land.” Blome doubted that rats could\\nswim great distances. He believed they could swim only for\\nas long as the air in their fur kept them aﬂoat. To prove his\\npoint, Blome arranged for a test on a Berlin lake. “About\\nthirty rats were taken out in a police boat and released at'),\n",

The\\nlongest any of the rats swam for was thirty minutes. Of\\nthose released a little over a half-mile from shore, only a\\nthird reached land. As far as Blome was concerned,\\nHimmler’s U-boat dispersal idea was not practical.\\nMeeting Number Two took place a month or two later, in\\nSeptember or October 1943, and was largely a repetition of\\nthe ﬁrst, at least according to Blome. There was one\\nsigniﬁcant development, however. Himmler asked Blome if\\nhe needed an assistant. Blome agreed that a bacteriologist\\nwould be helpful. Himmler assigned Dr. Karl Gross,\\nformerly a staﬀ member at the Waﬀen-SS Hygiene Institute.\\nThe two doctors did not get along. Blome became\\nconvinced that Dr. Gross had been sent by Himmler to spy\\non him. He told his interrogators that he was under great\\npressure to work faster. Himmler repeatedly “reiterated\\nthat the methods of waging BW [biological warfare] must\\nbe studied in order to understand the defense against it.”\\nWhat this meant was that Himmler wanted Blome to infect\\nhuman test subjects with plague to see what would happen\\nto them.\\nThe third meeting took place four or ﬁve months later, in\\nFebruary 1944. By this time, Blome said, the facility at\\nNesselstedt had been built. There was ample staﬀ housing,\\na well-equipped laboratory, and an animal farm. The block\\nfor experimental work included a climate room, a cold\\nroom, disinfectant facilities, and rooms for “clean” and\\n“dirty” experiments. There was an isolation hospital for\\nsixteen people in the event that workers on Blome’s staﬀ\\ncontracted the disease. Work progressed slowly, Blome\\nsaid, and Himmler became enraged.

There, Dr. Traub acquired a strain of the lethal\\nrinderpest virus. Under Blome’s direction, trials to infect\\nhealthy cows with rinderpest began. Riems, in northern\\nGermany in the Bay of Greifswald, was totally isolated and\\nself-contained. It was the perfect place for these dangerous\\ntests.

This would allow the British to evaluate various\\ntechnical elements, from how the rocket was launched to its\\nﬂight controls and fuels.

In late August 1945, Tilley got a very lucky lead\\nfrom Ambros’s former deputy, the Farben chemist Jürgen\\nvon Klenck. Von Klenck was back at Dustbin now, and under\\nintense scrutiny after having been in attendance alongside\\nAmbros at the meeting with Tarr and the representative\\nfrom Dow Chemical, Wilhelm Hirschkind. Jürgen von Klenck\\nhad amassed a sizable Dustbin dossier of his own. A Nazi\\nideologue, von Klenck had been a loyal party member since\\n1933 and an oﬀicer with the SS since 1936. One\\ninterrogator described him as “wily,” “untrustworthy,” and\\n“not employable.” Von Klenck was also an elitist and had\\nmade more than a few enemies because of this. Speaking in\\nconﬁdence with Major Tilley, fellow chemist and Dustbin\\ninternee Wilhelm Horn candidly expressed his thought\\nabout Jürgen von Klenck. Von Klenck had a “magnetic\\npresence, a brilliant mind, [was] handsome, polished and a\\nwonderful talker, but lack[ed] the essential characteristics\\nthat would make him a truly great man,” said Horn. This\\nwas because von Klenck was “an egoist… very proud of the\\nnobility implied in his name, and an opportunist who knew\\nhow to make the best of his chances.” Horn conﬁrmed that\\nvon Klenck was a long-standing and avowed Nazi but that\\n“it had always grated von Klenck’s pride that such common\\npeople as Hitler and his minions were in the highest\\nplaces,” said Horn.\\nTilley asked Horn how high up von Klenck was in the\\nproduction of war gases. Horn revealed that von Klenck had\\nbeen deputy chief of the ultra-secret Committee-C for\\nchemical weapons. In other words, Jürgen von Klenck was\\nOtto Ambros’s right-hand man. Armed with this\\ninformation, Major Tilley presented von Klenck with a piece\\nof paper to sign. It was a declaration, “stating that he knew\\nnone of which had been concealed by others.” Von Klenck\\nrefused to sign. Tilley explained that withholding\\ninformation was a crime.

He had hired someone to bury the steel\\ndrum on a remote farm outside Gendorf. Where, exactly,\\nvon Klenck said he wasn’t sure.

Between June 15, 1945, and August 9, 1945,\\nthe JIC wrote and delivered sixteen major intelligence\\nreports and twenty-seven policy papers to the Joint Chiefs.\\n“The most important JIC estimates involved the military\\ncapabilities and future intentions of the USSR,” says Valero.\\nThose intelligence estimates determined that the Soviets\\nwere ideologically hostile to the West and would continue to\\nseek global domination, an attitude they had managed to\\nskillfully conceal during the war. In September 1945, the\\nJIC advised the Joint Chiefs that the Soviet Union would\\npostpone “open conﬂict” with the West in the immediate\\nfuture but only so it could rebuild its military arsenal and by\\n1952 be back at ﬁghting strength. After this date, said the\\nJIC, the Soviets would be ready and able to engage the\\nUnited States in “total war.”\\nThe following month, JIC intelligence report 250/4 (the\\nfourth report in the JIC 250 series) warned the Joint Chiefs\\nthat “eight out of ten leading German scientists in the ﬁeld\\nof guided missiles” had recently gone missing from\\nGermany, had most likely been captured by the Soviets, and\\nwere now at work in the USSR.

In fact, there was\\nvery little for the Germans to do at Wright Field, and many\\nof them were restless. The Air Documents Research Center,\\nformerly in London, had also moved to the Air Material\\nCommand headquarters, at Wright Field. There, ﬁve\\nhundred employees sorted, catalogued, indexed, and put on\\nmicroﬁche some 1,500 tons of German documents captured\\nby Alsos, CIOS, and T-Forces after the war. So abundant was\\nthe material that more than one hundred thousand\\ntechnical words had been added to the Air Material\\nCommand’s English-language dictionary.

He\\nappealed to Albert Patin for help. At ﬁfty-eight, Patin was\\none of the more senior Germans at the Hilltop. He was a\\nwartime armaments contractor whose numerous factories\\nproduced equipment for the Luftwaﬀe under the Speer\\nministry.

Putt coveted the scientiﬁc inventions that Patin’s\\nfactories mass-produced, which included navigation aids,\\nin-ﬂight steering mechanisms, and automatic control\\ndevices. This kind of technology would give the Army Air\\nForces a ten-year jump on anything the Russians had, Putt\\nbelieved.\\nHiring Patin for a U.S. Army Air Forces contract meant\\nignoring his past. His armaments factories used slave labor,\\nwhich was a war crime. In an autobiographical report for\\nPutt, Albert Patin admitted that many of the people in his\\nsix-thousand-person workforce were slave laborers supplied\\nby Heinrich Himmler’s SS. Patin stated that he was not\\nashamed of this; he explained to Colonel Putt that he had\\nbeen one of the better bosses in the Third Reich. He didn’t\\nencircle his factories in electric fencing like other\\nindustrialists did. Patin acknowledged that his wartime\\naccess to Hitler’s inner circle beneﬁted his businesses, but\\nhe did not see how this made him a war proﬁteer. He was\\njust following orders. Patin took summer holidays with the\\nGöring family and winter trips with Albert Speer’s\\nmunitions procurement chief, Dieter Stahl, but so did a lot\\nof people. He was no better and no worse.\\nDuring this slow period at Wright Field, Colonel Putt had\\nAlbert Patin survey the other Germans. He told Patin to be\\nalert to grudges so that Patin could formalize his list of\\ncomplaints. Putt would in turn forward this summary to his\\nsuperiors at Air Materiel Command. Patin’s job, Putt\\ncounseled, was to emphasize how the Germans had become\\ndepressed, even suicidal, without their families and without\\nthe promise of long-term work. Colonel Putt sent Patin’s\\nsummary of complaints to Air Force Headquarters in\\nWashington, to the attention of Brigadier General John A.\\nSamford.

All mail sent to the scientists at Wright Field\\nwas screened by army intelligence ﬁrst. Albert Patin\\nregularly received letters from his staﬀ back in Germany,\\nmany of whom also sought work in the United States.

He sat\\ndown and began outlining his idea for America’s war-\\nﬁghting future in an opus that would become known as\\n“Psychochemical Warfare: A New Concept of War.” In the\\nmonograph, Greene wrote, “The trend of each major\\nconﬂict, being characterized by increased death, human\\nmisery, and property destruction, could be reversed.” His\\nseminal vision for psychochemical warfare—a term he\\ncoined—was to incapacitate a man with drugs on the\\nbattleﬁeld but not to kill him. Greene believed that in this\\nway the face of warfare could change from barbaric to\\nhuman. Incapacitating agents were “gentle” weapons; they\\nknocked a man out without permanent injury. With\\npsychochemical warfare, Greene explained, America could\\nconquer its enemies “without the wholesale killing of people\\nor the mass destruction of property.”\\nGreene was not proposing to use low levels of tabun gas\\non the battleﬁeld. He was talking about using other kinds of\\nincapacitating agents, drugs that could immobilize or\\ntemporarily paralyze a person, “hallucinogenic or\\npsychotomimetic drugs… whose eﬀects mimic insanity or\\npsychosis.” “There can be no doubt that their will to resist\\nwould be weakened greatly, if not entirely destroyed, by the\\nmass hysteria and panic which would ensue,” Greene\\nexplained.\\nGreene proposed that an immediate “search be made for\\na stable chemical compound which would cause mental\\nabnormalities of military signiﬁcance.” He sought drugs\\nthat made people irrational. In his monograph, Greene\\nprovided the army with a list of “61 materials known to\\ncause mental disorders.” These sixty-one compounds, he\\nsaid, should be studied and reﬁned to determine which\\nsingle compound would be the best possible incapacitating'),\n",

He had been\\nrecruited by Colonel Putt at Wright Field, now Wright-\\nPatterson Air Force Base. Putt wanted to make use of\\nSchieber’s underground engineering skills—just as Georg\\nRickhey’s skills had been used before Rickhey was returned\\nto Germany to stand trial for war crimes. Hiring a top Nazi\\nlike Walter Schieber was risky, and the potential problems\\nfacing the U.S. Air Force for doing so were candidly\\ndiscussed in an exchange of memorandums. A JIOA case\\noﬀicer wrote to military headquarters in Frankfurt\\nsummarizing how things were progressing. “Subject is Dr.\\nWalter Schieber… requested priority shipment to Wright\\nField. Schieber’s ability is outstanding and his potentialities\\nbelieved invaluable to the United States.” For the past\\nthree months, the case oﬀicer explained, Schieber had been\\nworking on “the underground factory project,” a massive\\nundertaking, at U.S. military headquarters in Germany. The\\nproject was spearheaded by Franz Dorsch, and Schieber\\nhad been working as Dorsch’s ﬁrst assistant. In Germany,\\nSchieber and Dorsch had supervised “150 scientists and\\ntechnicians” who had built underground factories for the\\nReich. The result was a thousand-page monograph for U.S.\\nAir Force. Schieber, the report explained, “has been\\nespecially cooperative and is agreeable to going to [the]\\nUnited States. He is well known to the Soviets and is\\ndesired by them. His exploitation in the United States is\\ntherefore believed highly desirable.”\\nThere was, however, a problem that needed to be\\naddressed, wrote the case oﬀicer. “His party record is as\\nfollows: Entered party in June 31, Brigade Fuhrer in the SS,'),\n",

Herr Berbeth also told\\nSchieber that he would recommend such a pardon.”\\nSchieber told his Paperclip handler that, after leaving the\\ncourtroom, he had returned to the internee camp where he\\nwas being held. Then, according to Schieber, something\\nrather shocking happened: “Berbeth of the court joined\\nSchieber and told him, contrary to his previous statement,\\nnot to apply for another trial or a pardon, but to go to\\nFrankfurt immediately, contact the Russian Liaison Oﬀicer\\nand ask for an Interzonal Pass.

Schieber claimed to have told the\\njudge that his oﬀer sounded impossible. Was he really being\\nadvised to ignore the court’s judgment, to ﬂee the camp,\\nget an interzonal pass, and begin working for the Russians\\n“at a high pay grade” comparable to what he was paid\\nduring the Hitler regime? “The President of the\\nSpruchkammer assured [me] that arrangements would be\\nmade,” Schieber said.

Here was a\\nbrigadier general with the U.S. Army doing business with a\\nformer brigadier general of the Third Reich allegedly in the\\ninterests of the United States.

There were no checks and no balances.\\nOperation Paperclip was becoming a headless monster.\\nThe CIA’s working relationship with the JIOA and Operation\\nPaperclip had begun within a few months of the Agency’s\\ncreation. Within the CIA, Paperclip was managed inside the\\nOﬀice of Collection and Dissemination, and one of the ﬁrst\\nthings requested by its administrator, L. T. Shannon, was “a\\nphotostatted copy of a set of ﬁles compiled by Dr. Werner\\nOsenberg and consisting of biographical records of\\napproximately 18,000 German scientists.” By the winter of\\n1948, hundreds of memos were going back and forth\\nbetween the JIOA and the CIA. Sometimes the CIA would\\nrequest information from the JIOA on certain scientists, and\\nsometimes the JIOA would ask the CIA to provide it with\\nintelligence on a speciﬁc scientist or group of scientists.\\nAlso in the ﬁrst three months of the CIA’s existence, the\\nNational Security Council issued Directive No. 3, dealing\\nspeciﬁcally with the “production of intelligence and the\\ncoordination of intelligence production activities within the\\nintelligence community.” The National Security Council\\nwanted to know who was producing what intelligence and'),\n",

In the opinion of the CIA, “the link between\\nscientiﬁc planning and military research on a national scale\\ndid not hitherto exist.” The result was the creation of the\\nScientiﬁc Intelligence Committee (SIC), chaired by the CIA\\nand with members from the army, the navy, the air force,\\nthe State Department, and the Atomic Energy Commission.\\n“Very early in its existence the SIC undertook to deﬁne\\nscientiﬁc intelligence, delineate areas of particular interest\\nand establish committees to handle these areas,” wrote SIC\\nchairman Dr. Karl Weber, in a CIA monograph that\\nremained classiﬁed until September 2008. “Priority was\\naccorded to atomic energy, biological warfare, chemical\\nwarfare, electronic warfare, guided missiles, aircraft,\\nundersea warfare and medicine”—every area involving\\nOperation Paperclip scientists. Eight scientiﬁc intelligence\\nsubcommittees were created, one for each area of warfare.\\nDespite the urgency, the JIOA’s plan to make Operation\\nPaperclip over into a long-term program was still at a\\nstandstill. By the spring of 1948, half of the one thousand\\nGerman scientists bound for America had arrived, but not a\\nsingle one of them had a visa. Troublemaker Samuel Klaus\\nwas gone from the State Department, but the JIOA could\\nstill not get the visa division to make things happen fast\\nenough. On May 11, 1948, military intelligence chief\\nGeneral Stephen J. Chamberlin, the man who had briefed\\nEisenhower in 1947, took matters into his own hands.\\nChamberlin went to meet FBI director J. Edgar Hoover to\\nenlist his help with visas. Cold War paranoia was on the\\nrise, and both men were staunch anti-Communists. The\\nsuccess of Operation Paperclip, said Chamberlin, was\\nessential to national security. The FBI had the Communists\\nto fear, not the Nazis. Hoover agreed.

Edgar Hoover said he\\nwould see what he could do. What, if anything, Hoover did\\nremains a mystery. Three months later, the ﬁrst seven\\nscientists had U.S. immigrant visas. Now it was time to put\\nthe transition process to the test.\\nFor Operation Paperclip, moving a scientist from military\\ncustody to immigrant status required elaborate and devious\\npreparation, but in the end the procedure proved to be\\ninfallible. Scientists in the southwestern or western United\\nStates, accompanied by military escort, were driven in an\\nunmarked army jeep out of the country into Mexico either\\nat Nuevo Laredo, Ciudad Juárez, or Tijuana. With him, each\\nscientist carried two forms from the State Department, I-55\\nand I-255, each bearing a signature from the chief of the\\nvisa division and a proviso from the Joint Chiefs of Staﬀ,\\nSection 42.323 of Title 22, signifying that the visa holder\\nwas “a person whose admission is highly desirable in the\\nnational interest.” The scientist also had with him a\\nphotograph of himself and a blood test warranting that he\\ndid not have any infectious diseases. After consulate\\napproval, the scientist was then let back into the United\\nStates, no longer under military guard but as a legal U.S.\\nimmigrant in possession of a legal visa. The pathway toward\\ncitizenship had begun. If the scientist lived closer to the\\nEast Coast than the West Coast, he went through the same\\nprotocols, except that he would exit the United States into\\nCanada instead of Mexico and reenter through the\\nconsulate at Niagara Falls.\\nIt was an international crisis in June of 1948 that ﬁnally\\ngave Operation Paperclip its long-term momentum. Early\\non the morning of June 24, the Soviets cut oﬀ all land and\\nrail access to the American zone in Berlin. This action would\\nbecome known as the Berlin Blockade, and it was seen as\\none of the ﬁrst major international crises of the Cold War.\\n“The Soviet blockade of Berlin in 1948 clearly indicated\\nthat the wartime alliance [between the Soviets and the'),\n",

The activities there between 1946 and the late\\n1950s have never been fully accounted for by either the\\nDepartment of Defense or the CIA.

After being liberated from Ravensbrück, she had\\nmoved to Paris, where she had been working as a journalist\\nfor Radio Free Europe. She also worked as the Paris-based\\ncorrespondent for several Polish newspapers in Western\\nEurope.\\nWhen Iwanska was experimented on at Ravensbrück she\\nwas only seventeen years old. While imprisoned there, she\\nand several other female prisoners had taken remarkable\\nsteps to get word outside the camp about what was being\\ndone by Nazi doctors at Ravensbrück. With the goal of\\ngetting their message to the Vatican, the BBC, and the\\nInternational Red Cross, Iwanska and four other women\\nsent secret messages to their relatives outside the camp.\\nRemarkably, a French prisoner named Germaine Tillion\\ntook photographs of the women’s wounds, then smuggled a\\nroll of ﬁlm out of the camp. The story was printed in the\\nPolish underground press during the war, notifying the\\nworld about the Ravensbrück medical experiments. The'),\n",

He wanted to quit or be\\nﬁred. Ruwet told him to give the issue some time and to get\\nback to work. But when Ruwet arrived for work the\\nfollowing morning at 7:30, he again found Frank Olson\\nwaiting for him. Olson’s mental state had deteriorated\\nconsiderably, and Ruwet decided that he needed medical\\nhelp. He called Agency headquarters, in Washington, D.C.,\\nand told Robert Lashbrook what was going on. Frank Olson\\nwas privy to the CIA’s most controversial behavior'),\n",

The ﬁrst Disneyland TV broadcast in which von Braun\\nappeared, in 1955, called Man in Space, had an estimated\\n42 million viewers and was reported to be the second-\\nhighest-rated television show in American history at the\\ntime. The following month, on April 15, 1955, von Braun\\nand many of his fellow German rocket scientists became\\nU.S. citizens, in a public ceremony held in the Huntsville\\nHigh School auditorium. In 1958, von Braun and his team\\nlaunched America’s ﬁrst successful space satellite, Explorer\\nI, as a quick response to the Soviets’ Sputnik. Kurt Debus\\nwas in charge of the launch.\\nIn 1960, von Braun and a group of approximately 120\\nOperation Paperclip scientists, engineers, and technicians\\nwere transferred from the army to the newly established\\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration, or NASA,\\nwith a mandate to build the Saturn rockets designed to take'),\n",

Von Braun was made director of the new\\nNASA facility, the Marshall Space Flight Center, also located\\nat the Redstone Arsenal, as well as chief architect of the\\nSaturn V launch vehicle, or “superbooster” rocket, as it\\nwould become known. Von Braun’s deputy developer on the\\nSaturn program was Arthur Rudolph, the former operations\\ndirector at the Mittelwerk slave labor facility.\\nThe Saturn V rocket would need its own launch complex\\nand hangar. Cape Canaveral, on Florida’s east coast, was\\nchosen as the perfect site. On July 1, 1962, NASA activated\\nits Launch Operations Center there, naming Kurt Debus as\\ndirector.

When a\\nreporter once asked him, incorrectly, about his joining the\\nparty “in 1942,” von Braun put his scientist’s precision\\naside and chose not to correct the newsman. Instead von\\nBraun did what he always did—he said that he’d been\\ncoerced into joining the Nazi Party. Never did von Braun\\nspeak of the SS cavalry unit he joined, in 1933, or that he\\nwas made an SS oﬀicer in 1944 and wore the SS oﬀicer’s\\nuniform, with its swastika on the armband and its cap with\\nthe death’s-head image.

Rückerl provided Wiesenthal with a copy of\\nthe documents pertaining to the conference, “Medical\\nProblems of Sea Distress and Winter Distress,” at the Hotel\\nDeutscher Hof in Nuremberg in 1942, including the travel\\nexpenses that Strughold had submitted and the amount he\\nwas paid to attend. The Luftwaﬀe doctors in attendance had\\ndiscussed the medical data of murdered people.

He agreed, and an interview was arranged for\\nFebruary 22, 1962.\\n“I have read the two pages you have presented to me,”\\nBlome told his interviewer on the appointed day. “During\\nthe war I got the task to prepare a serum, a vaccine,\\nagainst a bacterial plague.

It was illegal to write and send unscreened\\nnotes out of Spandau, so Speer had his writing smuggled\\nout by two sympathetic Dutch Red Cross nurses. The notes\\nwere delivered to Speer’s old friend and colleague Rudolf\\nWolters, a diehard Hitler loyalist living in Berlin.

In 2013, after the\\nStrughold award debate resurfaced, I interviewed Steve\\nGriﬀin, the National Space Club chairman, to determine\\nwhy the organization continues to give out an award that is\\nnamed after someone who was once an avowed and active\\nNazi.\\n“Simple as it is, Kurt Debus is an honored American,”\\nGriﬀin says. I read to Griﬀin information from Kurt Debus’s\\nOMGUS security report. “It is a simple matter,” Griﬀin told\\nme. “Kurt Debus was the ﬁrst director of the Kennedy\\nSpace Center.”'),\n",

Harvard ﬁled a\\nFOIA request on my behalf, and the “mercy killings” list was\\ndeclassiﬁed and released to me.\\nIncluded on this list, which had been in Colonel Benford’s\\npossession, were seven Nazi doctors hired under Operation\\nPaperclip: Theodor Benzinger, Kurt Blome, Konrad Schäfer,\\nWalter Schreiber, Hermann Becker-Freyseng, Siegfried\\nRuﬀ, and Oskar Schröder. The fact became instantly clear:\\nU.S. Army intelligence knew all along that these doctors\\nwere implicated in murder yet chose to classify the list and\\nhire the doctors for Operation Paperclip. Blome, Schäfer,\\nBecker-Freyseng, Ruﬀ, and Schröder were all tried at\\nNuremberg.

Is the American government at fault\\nequally for fostering myths about its Paperclip scientists—\\nfor encouraging them to whitewash their past so that their\\nscientiﬁc acumen could be exploited for U.S. weapons-\\nrelated work? When, for a nation, should the end justify the\\nmeans? These are questions that can only be answered\\nseparately, by individuals.

In this research, I\\noccasionally came across the name Siegfried Knemeyer, a\\nsenior adviser to the Horten brothers but, more notably, a\\nman with quite a title from World War II: technical adviser\\nto Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring. Not knowing much\\nabout Operation Paperclip back then, I was very surprised\\nwhen I learned that just a few years after the war’s end,\\nSiegfried Knemeyer was living in America working for the\\nU.S. Air Force, and that he would eventually be awarded the\\nU.S. Department of Defense Distinguished Civilian Service\\nAward—the highest civilian award given by the DoD. In\\n2010, I located Siegfried Knemeyer’s grandson, Dirk\\nKnemeyer, and asked if he would meet with me for an\\ninterview. He agreed.\\nDirk Knemeyer is an American father, husband,\\nentrepreneur, and businessman. By his own admission, he\\nspends a good deal of his time thinking philosophically\\nabout concepts of “identity,” “science,” “time,” and “life.”\\nWhen I ﬁrst met him, Dirk Knemeyer shared with me that\\nhe had never before spoken publicly about his\\ngrandfather’s wartime activities, and that most members of\\nhis family go out of their way to maintain silence about'),\n",

The conundrum\\ntherein is one of the notions that made me want to learn\\nmuch more about Operation Paperclip.\\n“Siegfried’s life is complicated,” Dirk Knemeyer says of\\nhis grandfather. “I am someone [who is] more interested in\\nlearning the truth about the past than denying it.
